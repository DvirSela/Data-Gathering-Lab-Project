# Overview

Our goal is to develop a recommendation system that helps companies and employers connect with job candidates who are the best fit for the job.

# Abstract

In todayâ€™s job market, connecting companies with the right people for the job is more challenging than ever. Common candidate evaluations rely on simple keyword searches or filters, which don't really capture the full picture of someone's skills, background, or career goals. This often results in job suggestions that miss the mark and fail to reflect a candidate's true potential.
To address this, we explored the use of machine-learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) embedding models to embed worker profiles and job listings into numerical vectors and meta industries - a broad representation of various industry categories that group similar sectors together. By turning text data, such as work experience, education, and job descriptions, into meaningful semantic vectors, we can better understand how similar a personâ€™s profile is to a job posting.
